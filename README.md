# BlissAI Chatbot

## üõë **Project Status**  
This project is currently on hold. After starting BlissAI, I realized that it was too complicated and messy from the beginning, which made it hard to keep working on. Recently, one of my father‚Äôs employees shared a new project idea with me. He is working on it for their company, and it seems more organized and fits better with what I want to do right now. Because of this, I am focusing on the new project for now.

BlissAI might still be continued in the future, but for now, this repository will stay inactive.

## üîç **Project Overview**  
BlissAI is an AI chatbot that combines frontend and backend technologies to create an interactive user experience. The project uses a Python backend with a Flask API to connect with a conversational AI, and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also has user authentication, account management (still in progress), and a database for storing user data. The goal was to make a full-stack app where users could chat with an AI easily.
